    SoapLibrary is a library for testing SOAP-based web services.

    SoapLibrary is based on [https://python-zeep.readthedocs.io/en/master/|Zeep], a modern SOAP client for Python.

    This library is designed for those who want to work with webservice automation as if they were using SoapUI,
    make a request through an XML file, and receive the response in another XML file.
